/*
Conditional play very important role in JS .Sometimes we want to excute code on the bases of some conditions lets code for it
*/

//First we take an example of driving
let age = 15; //created age variable

//The conditional syntax is look like this:

if (age > 18) {
  //It is condition for driving car or not if age is greater than 18 then this console will print
  console.log("You can drive");
} else {
  console.log("You cannot drive");
}
//"You can drive" print in console at this time becuase the age is greate than 18

//Let solve the exercise

//First Question:write a JavaScript program to check weather the number is divisible by 2 or 3

// let Number = 12;

// if (Number % 2 == 0 && Number % 3 == 0) {
//   console.log("The number is can divisible by 2 and 3");
// } else {
//   console.log("The number is cannot divisible by 2 and 3");
// }
